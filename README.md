# TheTownProject

A simple JavaScript app project for small town report

suppose that you're working in a small town administration, and you're in charge of two
town elements:

1. Parks
2. Streets

It's a very small town, so right now there are only 3 parks and 4 streets have a name and a build year.

At the end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following:

1. Tree density of each park in the town(formula: number of trees/park area)
2. Average age of each town's park(formula: sum of all ages/number of parks)
3. The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees
4. Total and average length of the town's streets
5. Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/huge.
   If the size unknown, the default is normal

All the report data should be printed to the console.

Hint: use some of the ES6 features: classes, subclasses, template strings, default parameters, maps,
arrow functions and destructuring.
